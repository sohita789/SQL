10.JDK:
  a). JDK is a java development kit, it is a software kit or a tool which is used to develop run and execute the programme.
   JDK is platform independent ,we  can run the program on any platform and run anywhere(operating system).
   The JDK consists of the tools like JVM ,in this we can convert or translate the byte code or the human readable language into Machine Level Language.
    java is Write once Run Anywhere.

  b). JRE :
    JRE means The java Runtime Environment
   JRE is a JDK tool in which we can only  Run the programmes and Execute the programs.
   JRE does'nt consists of the tools like compiler, or the Interpreter.

  c).JVM:
   JVM means the java virtual machine.
   JVM is a tool in which it consists of the compiler  etc.
   JVM is tool which translates the byte code which is written by the humans arre converted to machine language, called as the machine-level language.
   JVM creates an intermediate   code which is understood by the machine. 
 
12.
  Java is Known as platform Independent Because we can write the code on One platform(Operating System) and Run the programme Anywhere(operating System) without making Any changes to the code.
  java is set of instructions which helps to perform the tasks.
   

13.
   Class:
        Class is defined as a Set of objects ,which are referring to the same location or the same variable.
        In java Class is a Real world things which are used to define the objects.
       SYNTAX:
            class Projector{
            }

15.   A Variable is a Value or keyword which Keeps changing its location or address.
     In variable it is of TWo types:
      Local And Global variable.

16.  Local Variable:
      It is also variable which declared inside the class but outside the body of the method.A variable which is Declared inside the parenthesis of the method .

17.  Datatypes:

        Datatypes are referred to be as , the  information or the data which  is stored based upon their variety,kind of data and sze of the data in different types.
        In java Datatypes are of Two types :
  
         1).primitive datatype:  
         2).Nonprimitive datatype:
1). Primitive data type Consists of 8 types:byte,int short,long,boolean,double,char,float.
   depending on their various size and kind they are classified.
    They are declared variables.
2).NonPrimitive datatype:
     in java non primitive datatypes are infinite 
     They are user defined data types.
     It consists of undeclared variables.

     
18. main method:
     It is used to declare the method which is declared inside   the class but out of the main method.
     SYNTAX: 
           class Sohita{
                 public static void bangalore()
             {
             }
             }

19. Static method:
    The method Which calls the main method inside the classes .
    > Static method can only access the Static method.
    > Nonstatic method can access both the static and non static method.
    
Syntax:  
public static void machine()
{
System.out.println("running machine in the main method");
}
\
20.  program to check given no is odd or even
    
  class Number{
     public static void main(String[]args)
     {
     System.out.println("number:"+number);
if (num>=15)
 System.out.println("the number is even);
else
System.out.println("the number is odd);
}}}
